Explain what the ".map" properties of arrays does.

Map calls a function for every item in an array and creates a new array from the results.

Explain what the ".reduce" properties of arrays does.

How is ".map" different from reduce?

Map affects every element inside of an array to create a new array, reduce will 
only effect the elements in the array that you specify which will return a single value.

What are "switch" statements?

Switch statements evaluate similar to a series of “if else” statements. 
A switch statement looks for the first case that matches the value of the original expression, 
it then executes the associated statement.
